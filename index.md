## [M42: Inclusion â€“ not only in crystals: spotting and overcoming potential obstacles](https://www.ecm34.org/microsymposia-list)

A microsymposium at the 34th European Crystallographic Meeting (ECM34) in Padova

### Chairs
Hans, Philipp | Sadiq, Ghazala

### Description
This microsymposium aims at shedding light on the concepts of diversity, equality and inclusion with respect to social group dynamics. Mainly, it wants to raise or create awareness in the mainstream for people outside of the mainstream, to sensitize and give perspectives. On the basis of success stories and other personal perspectives, we want to show ways of dealing with and overcoming barriers. The focus can be broad and should not be seen as restricted to a special aspect. Contributors are encouraged to be aware that criteria such as social status, age, health concerns, issues like mobbing, language and many more can be addressed in this micro symposium which also aims to be a forum for everyone. Empirical evidence should be presented to examine the possibilities and benefits of inclusive and enabling behaviors to the community, pros, cons and obstacles in both directions. We want to understand factors that lead to individuals not being invited to a certain zone as well as factors that lead to actors not taking chances and anything complementary.

### When:
MS-42 is scheduled for Thursday 29th of August in the afternoon session (https://www.ecm34.org/program). More details or updates to follow.
